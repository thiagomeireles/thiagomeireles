# Welcome to my GitHub repository

Hi, my name is Thiago Meireles. I have a PhD in Political Science from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and my area of expertise is the relationship between artificial intelligence and the labor market. 

Throughout last years, I have dedicated myself to exploring this topic and understanding the implications it has for the future of work. I am passionate about using my knowledge and skills to help others better understand the impact of AI on the job market and how it will shape the future of employment. 

In addition, I am also a enthusiast of new research methodologies, especially those related to artificial intelligence and big data. I believe that incorporating these tools into my work can help me uncover new insights and further advance our understanding in many topics but with some parsimony about populational cover. I am also had taught courses in R programming, web scraping, and text mining at CEBRAPlab. 

Currently, I work as a data scientist in the coordination of quantitative methods at Cetic.br, in the methodological innovation team. In this role, I have the opportunity to apply my expertise to real-world problems, using data-driven insights to drive innovation and drive positive change. I am constantly looking for new ways to utilize my skills and knowledge to make an impact, and I am excited to be part of an organization that is at the forefront of developing cutting-edge solutions to complex problems in public data provision.
